About project:
Depression (major depressive disorder) is a common and serious medical illness that negatively affects how you feel,
the way you think and how you act. Fortunately, it is also treatable. Depression causes feelings of sadness and/or a loss of interest in 
activities you once enjoyed. It can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems and can decrease your ability to function at work and at home. 
If a patient is suffering with depression, he/she may suffer with diseases related to depression. 

Disease Prediction using Machine Learning is the system that is used to predict the diseases from the symptoms which are given by the patients or any user.
The system processes the symptoms provided by the user as input and gives the output as the probability of the disease. Random Forest algorithm 
is used in the prediction of the disease which is a unsupervised machine learning algorithm. With an increase in biomedical and healthcare data, accurate analysis of medical 
data benefits early disease detection and patient care. By using linear regression and decision tree we are predicting 
diseases like Diabetes, Blood pressure, Heart disease and Brain stroke.
 
Datasets:
ðŸ”˜There are two datasets for this project "Depression and Disease dataset".
ðŸ”˜Depression dataset contains 36000 samples and 34 attributes and Disease dataset contains 2800 samples and 24 attributes.

Machine learning Algorithms:
ðŸ”˜For Depression prediction model we have used SVM algorithm, Random Forest algorithm and Descision tree algorithm in which Random forest gives highest accuracy of 95%.
ðŸ”˜For Disease prediction model we have used Ensemble classifiers which contains multiple algorithms like SVM, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting algorithm and gives accuracy of 92%.

Features:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preprocessing of raw data.
Feature Engineering: Creation of new features to improve model performance.
Model Training: Training multiple machine learning models.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating and comparing model performance.
Prediction: Making predictions on new data.

Depression and Disease Algorithm:
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Asking question to the patients or user (related to depression) by using various machine learning algorithms
Step 3: Predicting depression on symptoms basis using Random Forest algorithm
Step 4: If prediction is "No depression" go to Step 8
Step 5: If prediction is "Depression exists" then continue
Step 6: Then we will predict possible diseases (Working on this module)
Step 7: It will predict disease type or no disease
StepÂ 8:Â End

How to run:
ðŸ”˜Create a pickle file for Depression prediction model by running "python dep_model.py" in new terminal
ðŸ”˜Create a pickle file for Disease prediction model by running "python disease_model.py" in new terminal
ðŸ”˜After generating pickle file run "python app.py" in terminal then project open on localhost server........
